=================================

In hindsight, mixing inheritance with a factory class really wasn't such a 
good idea.

As development progresses (and as I write more unit tests), I should see 
about cutting down on inheritance and use dependency injection instead.

I might want to switch to camelCase function names at some point, too.  I'm
going to use them for unit tests right now, and maybe I'll do the same
in the main classes in the future.
