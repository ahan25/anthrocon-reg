What is this?
=============

A pre-registration system for science fiction/anime/furry conventions that I am releasing to the community under the GNU Public License.

Features
--------

- Convention pre-registration with any valid credit card number. 
	(you'll need an authorize.net account)
- Multiple levels of membership can be offered, with different date ranges 
	for each level. Lets you do things like offer $5 off for registrations 
	before a certain date.
- Full statistics and reporting including a membership breakdown and 
	a **revenue report**.
- A verification page for members who want to make sure they registered 
	and have email confirmation re-sent.
- Multiple test modes for local testing/development.
- Onsite registration support, and printer client support for **printing 
	of physical badges** from 1 or more client machines.
- Watchlist support for individuals who owe the organization money before 
	a registration is allowed.
- **Template support** for automated emails, error messages, etc.
- **Full auditing/logging** to track which staff accessed what records, what 
	fields were changed and by whom, when badges were printed, etc.


Details
-------

Drupal 6 is required. If you want to use Authorize.net for charging credit 
cards, a module for that is included. Otherwise, you'll have to roll your 
own charging solution. (or contact me and we'll talk :-) )
