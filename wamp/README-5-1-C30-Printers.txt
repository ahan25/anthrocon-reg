C30 Printers:

- How to run a self-test:
	- Unplug printer
	- Hold pause button
	- Plug in printer
	- A card with lines and boxes will be printed

- Ribbon type should ALWAYS be "K: Premium Resin"

- Issue with a beep from the printer, followed by "wrong printer type installed" message:

	- The easy way:
		- Right click on the printer, go to Propties: Printing Preferences: Device Options
		- If ribbon type is "YMCKO" or similar, something is messed up.  
			Click "auto ribbon select", and it should be automatically 
			updated to "K - Premium Resin".  If that works, you've 
			communicated with the printer successfully, you should be 
			able to print.

	- The hard way:
		- Reinstall C30 driver
		- Reboot machine
		- Do a test print from the Printer Control panel or Notepad
