Badge Printing Doc
==================

We use a Word document as our base, with 3 bookmarks in the document
(one for badge name, badge number, and badge type).  The badge printing
software uses JScript (Microsoft's illigimate child of Javascript)
to drive Word and print up the badges.

To view bookmarks:
- Click Insert
- Click booKmark

The name of the 3 bookmarks you want are:
- badge_name
- badge_number
- membership_type

Be sure the file is named "badge.doc" and is an actual Word file
and not a template.
