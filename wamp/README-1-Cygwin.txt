Instructions for installing Cygwin
==================================

- Download setup program from their site
- Run program, choose to "install from Internet", with local files saved in a package directory
- If installing from an Anthrocon distribution, choose "All" packages, as we have a subset installed
- Recommended packages:
	- Default install (quicker than selecting a bunch of packages by hand)
	- devel/rcs
	- devel/subversion
	- editors/vim
	- editors/nano
	- archive/zipx
	- archive/unzip
	- net/openssh
	- utils/screen
	- web/wget
- If you run into problems about missing cygz.dll, do a full reinstall, but from the local directory of packages

- Download gvim separately for editing files under Cygwin

	- Do a "Full Install" if you want to use from the command line
