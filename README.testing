How to test our code
====================

- Set up the Simpletest module
	- Install php5-curl
	- Patch Drupal 6 Core

- Tests are in the tests/ directory

- Anything that ends with "Unit.test" is a unit test
	- Anything that ends with "Functional.test" is a functionality test

- Copy the file sites/all/modules/simpletest/run-tests.sh into the root scripts/ directory

- You should now be able to run the unit tests.  Here are some sample command lines:

./bin/run-reg-tests.sh reg-authorize-net
./bin/run-reg-tests.sh --verbose reg-authorize-net
./bin/run-reg-tests.sh --list 
./bin/run-reg-tests.sh --class Reg_Util_PrintBadge_Test
./bin/run-reg-tests.sh --verbose --class Reg_Util_PrintBadge_Test


Troubleshooting
===============

Use --verbose

Go to /admin/reg/settings and make sure that all of the test boxes are checked
