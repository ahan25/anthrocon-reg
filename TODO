TODO

- Stats
	- Revenue by month
		- Group by month?
	- Registrations by month
		- Check the created field in reg
		- Months are rows, total number are column

- It's nothing major, but if you go to the search page, search for some
	results, and then choose to download, only the first page (20 members)
	will be downloaded.  Whoops.

- Logs
	- Allow searching
		- By text
		- By username (should be a dropdown populated by a SELECT DISTINCT)

- Timezones when editing levels.  Do we want to do anything there?  
	- Maybe allow an hour?

- reg/verify/resend should redirect the user to reg/verify after sending the email

- authorize_net
	- When faking authorize.net, I should do this in the authorize_net 
		module as well, and parse the dummy result
		- This will ensure that more of the code is actually executed 
			in testing

- reg/
	autocomplete="off" in the input tag for the credit card number

- admin
	- Put 3 most recent log entries and 3 most recent transaction on this page

- admin/reg/settings/mesages/1234/edit
	- Prevent editing of non-existant message IDs
	- Throw an error and log it

- modify code to get the name and last 4 of the card number to get that name
	from the first digit

- Multi-year code
	- At signup, display a year field for the admin
	- For /reg, get year from from the level offering
	- Modify badge number assignment code to take a year argument

- Messages
	- When editing, instead of "ID 'id'", say "name 'name'"
	- When a message is saved, redirect to the list of messages

- reg-wide email on settings page
	- Remove variable_get() to email addresses
	- Add a box on the settings page that defaults to the site-wide email
	- Write reg_data::get_contact_email()

- Some utility to print unused badge numbers

- Keep in mind that I can create other modules in that directory
	- Dealer reg module?
	- Omaga List module?
	- Staff reg module
	- Onsite reg module?

- Admin
	- Resend confirmation email

- Class architecture
	- Function to send confirmation email for a specific registration
		- Store this confirmation email as a variable?

Long Term
=========

- Can we have an upgrade type?
	- Upgrade table that has a membership type, upgrade options, price, description, etc.

- Export data as a spreadsheet
	- Main membership data
	- Staff data separately?
