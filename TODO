- Refactor:
	- Create reg/member.class.php to hold memeber-centric functions
		- From reg_admin:
	        static function recent() {
    	    static function load_reg($id) {
        	static function view_reg($id) {
	        static function edit_reg($id) {
    	    static function add($id = "") {
		- From reg:
	        static function add_member($data, $reg_trans_id = "") {
    	    static function update_member($data) {

- Write search screen
	reg/search.class.php

- Track down bug with not forcing the badge number on a manual add.
	- Maybe put the badge code into the section before calling the new/update code?
	- Generic "isValidNumber()" function?
		- Check for positive and an integer
	- Generic "isValidMoney()" function?
		- Check for postive and a floating point number

- Add reg_level.description field

		- Refund?  Balance adjustment?
			- admin/reg/members/view/35/addtrans
				- Amounts (badge, donation)
			- admin/reg/members/view/35/cancel
				- Amounts prefilled in (0 for donation)

- Financials
	- Add to reg table: badge_balance, donation_balance
	- Add code that updates the reg_trans table to also update the badge balances

- Rename reg_log to reg_log_view and move log functions from reg into reg_log?

	- Display buttons for refund/balance adjustment?

	- Search registrations
		- Redirect back to search page with a query string like in onsitereg

	- Rename reg_trans.badge_cost to just cost?

- reg/verify - Let a user verify their reigstration
	- Ask for last 4 digits of credit card number and expiration date
	- Print lines of registrations
	- Maybe allow for upgrades this way?

- Some utility to print unused badge numbers

	- Keep in mind that I can create other modules in that directory
		- Omaga List module?
		- Onsite reg module?
		- Dealer reg module?

- is date_validate() being used on the reg form for dates?
- check on registration to make sure membership level is valid
	- Write a get_levels() function to return current, valid levels?
		- Possibly sort by cost?


- reg/
	- On successful registration, stash stuff to display in $_SESSION
		and go to a pre-filled verify page?
	- Have reg::get_cc_name() call reg::get_cc_last_4()
	- Save only last 4 digits of CC num to reg_trans.card_num
	- When a transaction fails, log it to reg_log with reg::get_cc_name()
	- When a membership is paid for, redirect to reg/verify with status messages
		and the form pre-filled

- Admin
	- View recent registrations
	- Search for registrations
