- Misc
	- Looking at http://api.drupal.org/api/function/t/5, I need to go back
		and change all t() calls that use %strings into !strings.

- Credit card gets charged twice with a captcha.  Oops.
	- Write my own little captcha in reg_captcha?
	- Can I use the existing captcha module for this? :-)
	- Can I use this on the verify page?

	- Staff reg module
	- Onsite reg module?


- reg/
	- On successful registration, stash stuff to display in $_SESSION
		and go to a pre-filled verify page?
	- When a transaction fails, log it to reg_log with reg::get_cc_name()
	- When a membership is paid for, redirect to reg/verify with status messages
		and the form pre-filled

		- Send confirmation email to another address
