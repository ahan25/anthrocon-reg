====

- is date_validate() being used on the reg form for dates?
	- PHP's checkdate() function

- reg_messages table

	- Wrap emails into messages?
		- Pros: Only a few rows in each table.
		- Cons, some messages are emailed, others would not be.
	- Wrapper in reg_message for displaying on the public pages
		- Log if we don't find the message
		- Link for editing on the public pages

	- settings/emails
	- Wrapper in reg_email for displaying on the public pages
		- Log if we don't find the message
		- Link for editing on the public pages

- Auditing
	- When a level is changed, display the changed/old data
	- When a membership is changed, display the changed/old data
	- reg_data::get_changed_data()

- Misc
	- Looking at http://api.drupal.org/api/function/t/5, I need to go back
		and change all t() calls that use %strings into !strings.

- /reg/success
	- Displays success data from $_SESSION["reg"]
		- If not found, redirects to /reg/verify

- Credit card gets charged twice with a captcha.  Oops.
	- Write my own little captcha in reg_captcha?
	- Can I use the existing captcha module for this? :-)
	- Can I use this on the verify page?

- Email sending
	- "Settings" menu item on left
		- default tab should be "Main Settings"
		- Separate tab for messages
			- Registration header

				- Email to member when signed up

	- Onsite reg module?


- reg/
	- On successful registration, stash stuff to display in $_SESSION
		and go to a pre-filled verify page?
	- When a transaction fails, log it to reg_log with reg::get_cc_name()
	- When a membership is paid for, redirect to reg/verify with status messages
		and the form pre-filled

- Admin
	- Resend confirmation email
		- Send confirmation email to another address
