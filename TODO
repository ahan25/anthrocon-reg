TODO
====

- Member search screen:
	- Add min badge number/max badge number for reg downloads

- Onsite reg
	- Create onsite reg form that doesn't have payment info
		- Create new class that calls reg_form->form() for form, but its own
			validation and submission functions?
			- Maybe split out reg_form->form into a separate class?
		- Thankyou text should be stored as a message
	- Create a form for staff members to "process/validate" registrations
		- Should only have a few fields.
		- Should have an option to print
	- WAMP issues
		- Folder to store Apache and MySQL configuration, SSL-generating scripts, etc.
			- Test an admin/reg/wamp menu item that blocks HTTP access to files in that directory

- reg/
	autocomplete="off" in the input tag for the credit card number

- I guess reg_admin_log_view isn't needed since we deprecated those other
	log viewing functions.
	- Let's go back and move that code back into reg_admin_log, and update
		child classes and the factory accordingly.

- If watchlist is empty, display a single row in the watchlist indicating that.

- Timezones when editing levels.  Do we want to do anything there?  
	- Maybe allow an hour field?

- admin/reg/settings/mesages/1234/edit
	- Prevent editing of non-existant message IDs
	- Throw an error and log it

- modify code to get the name and last 4 of the card number to get that name
	from the first digit

- Multi-year code
	- Have a config value for the year, defaulting to the current year
		- Modify badge number assignment code to first check the 
			reg_badge_num table
			- Write a unit test for this!
	- At signup, display a year field for the admin
		- Default to the current year
	- Add year to member search page
	- For /reg, get year from from the level offering
	- Modify badge number assignment code to take a year argument

- Messages
	- When editing, instead of "ID 'id'", say "name 'name'"
	- When a message is saved, redirect to the list of messages

- Theme
	- Work on the theme code at some point
	- Create hidden test page that shows all sorts of different form elements in a demo

- reg-wide email on settings page
	- Remove variable_get() to email addresses
	- Add a box on the settings page that defaults to the site-wide email
	- Write reg_data::get_contact_email()

- Onsite reg
	- Public page to take member info, but not billing info or payment details
	- New button on member details page: "Print Badge"
	- New security level: "reg staff"
	- Staff pages:
		- Search memberships
		- View Memberships
			- Display log entries
		- Edit Membership
			- Add note
			- Balance adjustment
		- Print badge

- Keep in mind that I can create other modules in that directory
	- Dealer reg module?
	- Staff reg module

	- Resend confirmation email

- Class architecture
	- Function to send confirmation email for a specific registration
		- Store this confirmation email as a variable?

Long Term
=========

	- Upgrade table that has a membership type, upgrade options, price, description, etc.

	- Main membership data
	- Staff data separately?
