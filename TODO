- Store and encrypt credit card numbers
	- Retrieve credit card numbers via an AJAX-powered button that will log the access

- reg/
	autocomplete="off" in the input tag for the credit card number

- I guess reg_admin_log_view isn't needed since we deprecated those other
	log viewing functions.
	- Let's go back and move that code back into reg_admin_log, and update
		child classes and the factory accordingly.

- If watchlist is empty, display a single row in the watchlist indicating that.

- Timezones when editing levels.  Do we want to do anything there?  
	- Maybe allow an hour field?

- admin/reg/settings/mesages/1234/edit
	- Prevent editing of non-existant message IDs
	- Throw an error and log it

- modify code to get the name and last 4 of the card number to get that name
	from the first digit

- Multi-year code
	- Have a config value for the year, defaulting to the current year
		- Modify badge number assignment code to first check the 
			reg_badge_num table
			- Write a unit test for this!
	- At signup, display a year field for the admin
		- Default to the current year
	- Add year to member search page
	- For /reg, get year from from the level offering
	- Modify badge number assignment code to take a year argument

- Messages
	- When editing, instead of "ID 'id'", say "name 'name'"
	- When a message is saved, redirect to the list of messages

- Theme

	- Create hidden test page that shows all sorts of different form elements in a demo

- reg-wide email on settings page
	- Remove variable_get() to email addresses
	- Add a box on the settings page that defaults to the site-wide email
	- Write reg_data::get_contact_email()

- Onsite reg
	- Public page to take member info, but not billing info or payment details

	- Staff pages:
		- Search memberships
		- View Memberships

Long Term
=========

	- Staff data separately?
