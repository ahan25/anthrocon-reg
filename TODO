====

- is date_validate() being used on the reg form for dates?
	- PHP's checkdate() function

- reg_messages table
	- id, key, value fields
	- When updated, save the old version in the log
	- Form for edting
	- settings/messages
	- store reg_messages in sample_data
	- store reg_emails in sample_data

- /reg/success
	- Displays success data from $_SESSION["reg"]
		- If not found, redirects to /reg/verify

- Credit card gets charged twice with a captcha.  Oops.
	- Write my own little captcha in reg_captcha?
	- Can I use the existing captcha module for this? :-)
	- Can I use this on the verify page?

- Email sending
	- "Settings" menu item on left
		- default tab should be "Main Settings"
		- Separate tab for messages
			- Registration header

		- Separate tab for "Emails"
			- Sub tab for each email:
				- Email to member when signed up

	- Staff reg module
	- Onsite reg module?


- reg/
	- On successful registration, stash stuff to display in $_SESSION
		and go to a pre-filled verify page?
	- When a transaction fails, log it to reg_log with reg::get_cc_name()
	- When a membership is paid for, redirect to reg/verify with status messages
		and the form pre-filled

- Admin
	- Resend confirmation email
		- Send confirmation email to another address

Long Term
=========

- Learn how to do updates through Drupal
