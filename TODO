TODO

- Refactor and update the reg codebase

	- Move constants from reg_form into reg::get_constant()
		- Update all references
		- Search for ::
			- find . -type f -name \*.class.php -exec grep -i --with-filename :: {} \;

	- Remove all "new" in any place but the factory class and reg.module
	- Put a single factory instance in the reg.module file

- Issues with falling back a timezone:
	- select id, reg_id, first, middle, last, card_expire, from_unixtime(card_expire)  from reg_trans where reg_id=53;
		- reg_id=2 has this too.  Probably everything before the timezone change
	- Can I add 86,000 seconds to all transactions?
		- How about checking the date and adding a day if not 1?
	- Can I use gmdate() for display/formatting?

- reg/verify/resend should redirect the user to reg/verify after sending the email

- reg/
	autocomplete="off" in the input tag for the credit card number

- admin
	- Put 3 most recent log entries and 3 most recent transaction on this page

- admin/reg/settings/mesages/1234/edit
	- Prevent editing of non-existant message IDs
	- Throw an error and log it

- modify code to get the name and last 4 of the card number to get that name
	from the first digit

- Multi-year code
	- At signup, display a year field for the admin
	- For /reg, get year from from the level offering
	- Modify badge number assignment code to take a year argument

- Messages
	- When editing, instead of "ID 'id'", say "name 'name'"
	- When a message is saved, redirect to the list of messages

- Logs
	- Allow searching

- reg-wide email on settings page
	- Remove variable_get() to email addresses
	- Add a box on the settings page that defaults to the site-wide email
	- Write reg_data::get_contact_email()

- Some utility to print unused badge numbers

- Keep in mind that I can create other modules in that directory
	- Dealer reg module?
	- Omaga List module?
	- Staff reg module
	- Onsite reg module?

- Admin
	- Resend confirmation email

- Class architecture
	- Function to send confirmation email for a specific registration
		- Store this confirmation email as a variable?

Long Term
=========

- Can we have an upgrade type?
	- Upgrade table that has a membership type, upgrade options, price, description, etc.

- Export data as a spreadsheet
	- Main membership data
	- Staff data separately?
